## Automatic Installation
At first, clone or download the repository.

The tool uses image processing libraries and has to be executed with nodejs, therefore some dependencies are required.

You can eiher use the installation scripts (`init.bat` for Windows, `init.sh` for Debian based distros) or use manual installation. The installation scripts will download all dependencies for you. To execute them, double click the `.bat` file on windows or execute the `.sh` file in the terminal on linux after adding execution permissions to the `.sh` file.

## Manual Installation
At first, clone or download the repository. Then follow the os-specific instructions below:

### Windows
1. Download `unifont-15.0.01.ttf` from http://www.unifoundry.com/pub/unifont/unifont-15.0.01/font-builds/unifont-15.0.01.ttf and put it in the project root
1. Install `ffmpeg` and put the ffmpeg executable (named as `ffmpeg`) in the project root or add it to your path environment variable, if you need help you can follow [this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows) tutorial
1. Install `mutool` and put the mutool executable (named as `mutool`) in the project root or add it to your path environment variable, you can find the most recent builds [here](https://mupdf.com/releases). Search for releases with `windows`. (only required for book2look and cornelsen.ch)
1. Install `nodejs` and `npm` if you haven't already, you can find help [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)
1. Run `npm install`
1. Optionally install `image magick` and put the magick executable (named as `magick`) in the project root or add it to your path environment variable (required only for cornelsen "old method")

## Running
Complete the setup by running `npm install` in the project directory and
start the program by executing `npm start` from the project directory.

## Saving credentials to avoid entering them every time (optional)
You can save your credentials in a `config.json` file to avoid entering them every time you start the program. To do this, create a file named `config.json` in the project root and add the following content:

```json
{
    "[PUBLISHER]": {
        "email": "[YOUR_USERNAME_OR_EMAIL]", 
        "passwd": "[YOUR_PASSWORD]"
    },
    "[PUBLISHER]": {
        "email": "[YOUR_USERNAME_OR_EMAIL]", 
        "passwd": "[YOUR_PASSWORD]"
    }
    [...]
}
```

Replace all the square brackets with your data. Publisher keys are: `cornelsen`, `klett`, `allango`, `scook`, `westermann`, `clicknstudy`, `kiosquemag`, `cornelsench`, `book2look`
